INTRODUCTION :-
Blueprint for a mental health assessment website that incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This website will ask users 15 questions related to their mental health, provide a rating based on their answers, offer suggestions for depression, and list government helplines and nearby psychiatrists:

1.	Homepage:
o	Display a welcoming message and brief introduction to the assessment.
o	Include a “Start Assessment” button that leads to the assessment form.
2.	Assessment Form:
o	Create a form with 15 questions related to mental health.
o	Use radio buttons or checkboxes for answers (e.g., “Yes” or “No”).
o	Example questions: 
-->	“Do you feel sad most of the time?”
-->	“Have you lost interest in activities you used to enjoy?”
-->	“Do you have trouble sleeping?”
	… (repeat for other questions)
3.  Include a “Submit” button.
4.	Result Page:
o	Display the mental health rating (e.g., “Moderate depression”) on the result page.
o	Provide personalized suggestions based on the severity level: 
-->	Mild: Encourage self-care practices (e.g., exercise, mindfulness).
-->	Moderate: Suggest seeking professional help (therapy, counseling).
-->	Severe: Urgently recommend contacting a psychiatrist.
o	List government helplines for mental health support.
o	Display details of a nearby psychiatrist (name, address, contact information).
5.	CSS Styling:
o	Apply CSS styles to make the website visually appealing.
o	Use calming colours and clear fonts for readability.
6.	JavaScript (Backend):
o	Enhance user experience by adding interactivity (e.g., showing/hiding questions dynamically).
o	Validate form inputs before submission.
o	Implement a Python script (using Flask or other frameworks) to handle form submission.
o	Calculate a mental health rating based on the user’s answers (e.g., count “Yes” responses).
o	Determine the severity level (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) based on the rating
